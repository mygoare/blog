When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.

That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

**译文：**

在你成长的过程中，肯定一直会有人告诉你:世界原本就是这样，你的人生使命就是在这固有的世界中很好地生存，建立一个美满的家庭，多存一点钱，并尽量寻找生活的乐趣。

其实这是非常狭隘的人生观，生活的舞台是非常广阔的。实际上，你生命中很多事物的缔造者甚至还没有你聪明和智慧，当你懂得了这么一个简单的道理之后，你会发现其实你也可以改变生活、影响世界，你可以创造属于你自己的东西，你的生命也将从此与众不同。
