You may happen to face the problem like this: in your "open with" lists there may have duplicate items or one application you already removed. So, they are trash now.

Then, how can we solve this problem? ok, I find the solution [here](http://itpixie.com/2011/05/fix-duplicate-old-items-open-with-list/#.UPkzX6GDT-k), what you need to do is just copy the command below:

<script src="https://gist.github.com//10342203.js"></script>

It can run on Lion & Mountain Lion.
