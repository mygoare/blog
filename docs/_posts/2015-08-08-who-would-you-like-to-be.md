title: Who would you like to be?
---


I have been thinking about this a lot lately.

Person #1

Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start. Start.

Person #2

Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish. Start. Finish.

A reminder to myself and anyone who reads this: Be person #2. **Be a finisher.**
