    Here's to the crazy ones.
    The misfits.
    The rebels.
    The troublemakers.
    The round pegs in the square holes.
    The ones who see things differently.
    They're not fond of rules
    And they have no respect for the status quo.
    You can praise them, quote them, disagree with them
    disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.
    About the only thing that you can't do is ignore them.
    Because they change things.
    They invent. They imagine. They heal.
    They explore. They create. They inspire.
    They push the human race forward.
    Maybe they have to be crazy.
    How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?
    Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?
    Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
    We make tools for these kinds of people.
    While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
    Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can
    change the world, are the ones who do.
