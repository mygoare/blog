Talking with leo ( my tech leader, australian ), it seems that we still have a long way to go to achieve
 our final goal. But we have known the future direction to step, although it may change frequently by time.

Actually, I do not very much understand his words, not the meaning of the each word but the sentences, I feel it must be interesting and would like to roll in and explore more.

In any case, the more exciting thing needs deeper passion to discover, then we learn more and tell more.
